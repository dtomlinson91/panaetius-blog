Optimisation:
    ☐ Change the gulp task that minifies images to be used only when a new one is added
    The img minimifer in gulp is running repeatedly against images in `public`.
    Should only run it after a SyncFromS3 or after adding a new image.
    Should run against the source image files, not `public`.
