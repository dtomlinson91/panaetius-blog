App.js:
  ☐ Document using the `/* webpackChunkname: "name" */
  ☐ What does `const { default: App }` do?

Plugins:
  ☐ Add `purgecss-webpack-plugin`: <https://pusher.com/tutorials/webpack-part-7>.
    Notes:
      Do this after the html templates have been added - this will only import the css classes that have been used.

Layout:
  ☐ Make sure the contents of app.js and main.js are documented. Specifically the content of main.js so it imports the app.js.
